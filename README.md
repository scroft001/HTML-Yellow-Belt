# HTML-Yellow-Belt
 All of the completed HTML yellow belt projects for Hackingtons.com. Teacher Resource

The goal of the yellow belt is to introduce the students to CSS in an external style.css file. The projecs go over basic styling principles and linking that external file to their index.html

Each project should only take 1 class period to complete but they may take longer if they want.

Target ages: 9+ or 8+ if they have some coding experience.

This is where the art students start to shine. For the youngest students don't worry about teaching what looks good, just have fun. The older students should have an eye towards making it look good.

The topics can be chosen by the student and does not have to follow the video topic but does need to resemble the structure of the video.

Students should watch the skill vidoes prior to building the projects. They do not need to "build" the skill videos.

# Common-problems:
    1) Not linking style.css file in head.
    2) All CSS is on one line. Try to teach basic indentation and line spacing
    3) Background is misspelled.
